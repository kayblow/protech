Uploading your HTML code to GitHub involves several steps, including creating a repository and then pushing your code to it. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### Step 1: Set Up a GitHub Account
1. **Sign Up:** If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account.
   
### Step 2: Install Git
2. **Install Git:** If you haven’t installed Git on your computer, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub
3. **Create a Repository:**
   1. Go to your GitHub account.
   2. Click on the **“+”** icon in the upper right corner and choose **“New repository.”**
   3. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `my-html-project`).
   4. Optionally, add a description.
   5. Choose to make it either **public** or **private**.
   6. Check the box to **“Initialize this repository with a README”** if you want (you can add this later).
   7. Click **“Create repository.”**

### Step 4: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
4. **Clone the Repository:**
   1. On the repository page, click on the green **“Code”** button.
   2. Copy the URL (HTTPS) provided.
   3. Open your terminal/command prompt.
   4. Navigate to the folder where you want to clone your repository using `cd path/to/folder`.
   5. Run the command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/my-html-project.git
      ```
      Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `my-html-project` with your repository name.

### Step 5: Add Your HTML Code
5. **Add Your HTML Code:**
   1. Navigate into your cloned repository:
      ```bash
      cd my-html-project
      ```
   2. Copy your HTML files (e.g., `index.html`, styles, scripts) into this directory.

### Step 6: Stage, Commit, and Push Your Changes
6. **Stage Your Changes:**
   - Run the command to stage all your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   
7. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Commit your changes with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit with HTML files"
     ```

8. **Push Your Changes to GitHub:**
   - Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Note: If your default branch is called `master`, replace `main` with `master`.

### Step 7: Verify Your Upload
9. **Verify:** Go back to your GitHub repository page, and you should see your HTML code and files uploaded.

### Additional Notes
- If you plan to host your HTML site using GitHub Pages, ensure your main HTML file is named `index.html`.
- You can continue to make changes to your local files, and whenever you're ready, repeat the steps of staging, committing, and pushing your changes to update your repository.
- It's a good practice to refer to the Git documentation for more advanced features and commands.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you should now have your HTML code successfully uploaded to GitHub. Enjoy coding and sharing your projects!
